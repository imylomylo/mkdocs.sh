# z_getbalance "address" ( minconf )

Returns the balance of a taddr or zaddr belonging to the nodeâ€™s wallet.

CAUTION: If address is a watch-only zaddr, the returned balance may be larger than the actual balance,
because spends cannot be detected with incoming viewing keys.

2. minconf          (numeric, optional, default=1) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.

Result:
```
amount              (numeric) The total amount in KMD received for this address.


```
Examples:
```

The total amount received by address "myaddress"
